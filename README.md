This was my first project after taking the python for everybody course. I plan to make more projects, but I wanted to start with something that interested me. I used my newly gained python skills and love for physics to make a calculator that takes in inputs of thrust, weight(of the rocket), and burn time, in seconds, and gives an output of altitude in kilometers and your final velocity in meters per second. 
Example: 
input: 
-Mass: 50 kg
-Thrust: 1000 N
-Burn Time: 5s
The output includes an ineractive count down, real time markers telling you what is calculated at that moment, and your Max altitude: 102.34 m and Final Velocity: 45.68 m/s.
