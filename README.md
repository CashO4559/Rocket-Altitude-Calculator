This was my first project after taking the python for everybody course. I plan to make more projects, but I wanted to start with something that interested me. I used the skills I learned to make a calculator that takes in inputs of thrust, weight(of the
the rocket), and burn time in seconds and gives an output of altitude in kilometers and your final velocity. 
Example: 
input: 
-Mass: 50 kg
-Thrust: 1000 N
-Burn Time: 5s
Output: Max altitude: 102.34 m and Final Velocity: 45.68 m/s
